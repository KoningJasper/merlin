Merlin
======

Scalable multi-device theme for [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/). Includes various extensions, such as a speed graph, not available on the stock theme.
Right now it's seriously lacking basic functions but the most rudimentary functions are there. Also it includes some weird glitches. Furthermore the code is most likely as inefficient and ugly as hell, but it works for the most part. And it looks kinda good.
