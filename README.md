Merlin
======

Scalable multi-device theme for [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/). Includes various extensions, such as a speed graph, not available on the stock theme.
**THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS!** Right now it's seriously lacking functions but the most rudimentary functions are there. Also it has some weird glitches. Furthermore the code is most likely as inefficient and ugly as hell, but it works for the most part.
