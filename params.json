{"name":"Merlin","tagline":"SABnzbd theme","body":"Merlin\r\n======\r\n\r\nScalable multi-device theme for [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/). Includes various extensions, such as a speed graph, not available on the stock theme.\r\nRight now it's seriously lacking basic functions but the most rudimentary functions are there. Also it includes some weird glitches. Furthermore the code is most likely as inefficient and ugly as hell, but it works for the most part. And it looks kinda good.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n* Grab the latest version from [here](https://github.com/sloth-o-naut/merlin/archive/master.zip).\r\n* Extract to `...SABnzbd_Path.../interfaces/Merlin`.\r\n* Open SABnzbd.\r\n* Go to `Config->General->Skins` and select `Merlin`.\r\n* Press restart.\r\n\r\n### Includes\r\n* [Flat-UI](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/)\r\n* [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/)\r\n* [HTML5Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv)\r\n* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)\r\n* [Respond](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond)\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n**Jasper Koning**\r\n+ [@KoningJasper](https://twitter.com/koningjasper)\r\n+ [Website](http://sloth-o-naut.com)\r\n+ [GitHub](https://github.com/sloth-o-naut/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
